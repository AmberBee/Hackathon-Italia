## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions and the list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure all the info is accurate and can be verified on the event website.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Use the same casing used on the website or fallback to [title-casing](http://titlecase.com/) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `{{HACKATHON NAME}} | {{ORGANIZER}} | {{LOCATION}} | {{START DATE (DD/MM/YY)}} - {{END DATE (DD/MM/YY)}} | {{FREE? (YES|NO)}} | [Registration and info]({{WEBSITE}})`
- New hackathon should respect the chronological order, based on `{{START DATE}}`, if `{{START DATE}}` is equal check `{{END DATE}}`.
- Check your spelling.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions and help!
